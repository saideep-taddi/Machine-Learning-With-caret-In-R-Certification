# Machine-Learning-With-caret-In-R-Certification


## Key Topics Covered
- Introduction to `caret`
- Data Preprocessing
- Feature Selection & Engineering
- Model Training & Evaluation
- Hyperparameter Tuning
- Handling Class Imbalances
- Cross-Validation & Performance Metrics

## Installation
Ensure you have R and the necessary packages installed. Run the following command in R to install `caret` and other dependencies:

```r
install.packages(c("caret", "tidyverse", "ggplot2", "randomForest", "e1071"))
```

## Usage
Run an example model training script:

```r
source("scripts/train_model.R")
```

Or execute the Jupyter/R Markdown notebooks inside the `notebooks/` folder for interactive learning.

## Certification Guide
To earn the certification, follow these steps:
1. Complete all exercises in the `notebooks/` directory.
2. Train and evaluate at least three different machine learning models.
3. Submit a final project applying `caret` to a real-world dataset.
4. Pass the certification assessment.
